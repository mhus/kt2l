# Intro

Hello!

The goal of KT2L is to provide a desktop tool to work with kubernetes clusters.

* A comprehensive web-based tool harnessing the capabilities of the web to offer enhanced support 
  for administrators compared to traditional shell-based tools. For instance, it includes direct 
  links to relevant documentation and context menus.
* Facilitate extensive keyboard navigation within the web browser for improved accessibility.
* Implement ingenious solutions to assist administrators in their tasks effectively.
* Offer a highly customizable environment, allowing tailored configurations to suit specific needs.
* Incorporate role-based user management, allowing for a read-only application view for certain users.
* Support the administrator in their daily tasks by providing intelligent insights, automating routine 
  tasks, and enhancing decision-making processes.
* Role-based resources and user management.
* Help system for administrators using active assistance systems like AI chatbots or snippets and 
  examples library.
* Ensures robust security measures are in place to safeguard sensitive data and system integrity.

And why use a java backend server instead of a frontend only react application?

* If the api is not accessible from the internet, the backend server allows you to access the system.
* I like java and why not use it?

# Applications

* As local administrative tooling for Kubernetes clusters.
* As remote administrative tooling for Kubernetes clusters.
* As a view-only tool for Kubernetes clusters for non-administrative users.
