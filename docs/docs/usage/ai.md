# AI

AI will analyze each selected resource. The AI panel will show the results of the analysis.
In the Question text field, you can ask a question about the resources. Use the placeholder
`{{content}}` to refer to the content of the resource. The AI will try to answer the question
based on the content of the resource.

If you do not provide the `{{content}}` placeholder, it will automatically be added to the question.
To suppress the automatic addition of the `{{content}}` placeholder, start the question with a 
hash `#` character.

This is not a chatbot. The AI will not have a memory of previous questions or answers. 
It will only analyze the content of the resource.

Use `Control+Enter` in the question text field or the "Ask" button to ask the question.
