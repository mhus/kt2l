# Edit Secret


This editor allows you to edit entries in a Secrets. You can add, edit, or delete entries in the Secret.

After saving the changes, the Secret will be updated in the cluster. But you have to restart pods that use the
Secret to apply the changes. This will not be done automatically by kubernetes.
