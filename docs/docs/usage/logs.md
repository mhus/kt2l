# Logs

This panel will show the logs of one or more pods. If more then one pod is selected, the logs will be shown in
different colors and with the pod name as prefix. The logs are updated in real time.

You have several options to manipulate the logs in the `View` menu. To download or capture the logs, 
use the `Store` menu. Logs are stored in the storage system. You can access and download them 
in the `Storage` panel. 

`Capture` will store the new arriving logs and `Download` will download the hole log files.

In the 'filter' field you can enter word match or with trailing '/' a regular expression to filter the logs.
