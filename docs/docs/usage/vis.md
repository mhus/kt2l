# Visualisation

The visualisation panel is a powerful tool to visualise data with vis.js. It shows the entities 
and their relationships in a graph.

Manipulate the visible entities by selecting the entity types in the right sidebar. The graph
will be updated automatically. Choos namespace and resource types to filter the entities.

You can use the preset filters to show only the entities of a certain type. The filters are
located in the top right corner of the visualisation panel.
